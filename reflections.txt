How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent all of Monday 1/25/2016 working on this project

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge was working with various object types at the same time (i.e. in the Transactions)

What two additional features did you build? Why?
The two additional features I added was date of purchase (to the Transaction class) and customer email address (to the Customer class). 
I added these two features since these hold vital information in a real-world purchase.

Where do you still have room to grow?
I need to keep working with OOP concepts and programming.
